			<p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p>

			<p>Your experience on the battlefield has honed your fighting techniques. You learn Maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Maneuvers.</em></strong> You learn three different Maneuvers of your choice from the “Maneuvers Options” section later in this subclass’s description. Many Maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one Maneuver per attack. You learn two additional Maneuvers of your choice when you reach Fighter level 7, 10, and 15. Each time you learn new Maneuvers, you can also replace one Maneuver you know with a different one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Superiority Dice.</em></strong> You have four Superiority Dice, which are d8s. A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest. You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Fighter level 7 (five dice total) and 15 (six dice total).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Saving Throws.</em></strong> If a Maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
