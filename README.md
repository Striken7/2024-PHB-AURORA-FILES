# 2024-PHB-AURORA-FILES
My personal collection of XML files to implement 2024 PHB information into the Aurora Character Builder. I am not a professional programmer, coder, or QA tester. All files are considered "works in progress". All 2024 PHB options will not overide other content and be listed seperately.

Note: Files are being tested using other 2024 PHB content. No testing has been done with 2014 content or content from other sources.
<br/><br/><br/>
Implementation Status:
<br/><br/>
Species: All species have been implemented.

Feats: All feats have been implemented.

Languages: All languages have been implemented.

Backgrounds: Only a Custom Background option has been implemented meeting the 2024 Background rules.

Spells: Limited progress, mostly to the spells added directly by Species or Feats.

Monk (all sublcasses) has been implemented.

Fighter (all subclasses) has been implemented.
