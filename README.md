# 2024-PHB-AURORA-FILES
My personal collection of XML files to implement 2024 PHB information into the Aurora Character Builder. I am not a professional programmer, coder, or QA tester. All files are considered "works in progress".

Note: Files are being tested using other 2024 PHB content. No testing has been done with 2014 content or content from other sources.

Implementation Status:

Species: All species have been implemented.

Feats: All feats have been implemented.

Languages: All Languages have been implemented.

Backgrounds: Only the Custom Background option has been implemented.

Spells: Limited progress, mostly to the spells added by Species or Feats.
