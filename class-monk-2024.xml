		<description>
			<p>Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, an elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p>
			<p class="indent">Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its clothwrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>      
			<h4>MONK'S FOCUS</h4>
			<p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call focus. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their Unarmed Strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>
			<h4>TRAINING AND ASCETICISM</h4>
			<p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p>
			<p class="indent">The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p>
			<p class="indent">For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p>      
			<h4>CREATING A MONK</h4>
			<p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p>
			<p class="indent">Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?</p>
			<p class="indent">As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness mystic energy. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk table.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you spend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended Focus Points back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your Focus Points.</p>

			<center>

			</center>
			<h6>FLURRY OF BLOWS</h6>
			<p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 Focus Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a bonus action.</p>
			<h6>PATIENT DEFENSE</h6>
			<p>You can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.</p>
