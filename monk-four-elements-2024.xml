			<p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</p>

			<p>At the start of your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to imbue yourself with elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition. You gain the following benefits while this feature is active.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reach. When you make an Unarmed Strike, your reach is 10 feet greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.</li>
				<li>Elemental Strikes. Whenever you hit with your Unarmed Strike, you can cause it to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage rather than its normal damage type. When you deal one of these types with it, you can also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward you or away from you, as elemental energy swirls around it.</li>
